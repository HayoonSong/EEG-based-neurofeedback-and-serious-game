## Neurofeedback game for cognitive enhancement
### Theory
Neurofeedback is a type of **biofeedback** in which neural activity is measured and presented through sensory channels to the participant in real time to **facilitate self-regulation of the putative neural substrates** that underlie a particular behaviour or pathology(Sitaram, 2017). [[Paper]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.164)

Both pronounced and persistent oscillatory patterns expressed during Neurofeedback would be associated with tangible and **long-lasting (plastic) changes** in motor-evoked potential (MEPs) elicited by TMS of primary motor cortex(Ros, 2010).
